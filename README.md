# Simple-Chess

This is just something I made because I could. I saw that utf-8 had chess pieces as characketers 
and I toght it would be fun to create a chess program with plain HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The program isn't finished yet, there are some bugs and I havent managed to get a chess "AI" working yet.
